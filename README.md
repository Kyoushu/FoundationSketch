# FoundationSketch

A set of CSS and JS to prototype sites with the appearance of a sketch.

The idea of not showing a technical prototype to start with but a sketch to show ideas of wireframes. The HTML can be used to take the prototype further and not a vast amount of time is used in getting the initial sketch ideas in a presentable state - ideal for small quick projects. 

Work in progress
